* This is a new release.
* Default write location is set to `repo_path = NULL`
* Example from the R6 class documentation has been copied to the documentation of the methods `$generate()` and `$write()`
* All examples in tests / examples / vignettes now use `file.path(tempdir(), "autonewsmd")` as temporary location for writing files.
